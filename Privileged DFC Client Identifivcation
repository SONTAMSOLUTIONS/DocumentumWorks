Open command prompt and navigate to the folder where dfc.properties for your DFC client is located. This folder should contain a file named dfc.keystore. This folder is usually WEB-INF/classes for WDK applications.
Run Java command keytool -list -keystore dfc.keystore -v. You’ll be asked to enter keystore password. The default password is the acronym for the Documentum Java API in lower case . You can also find the default password in dfcfull.properties
Once you enter the password, you’ll get the detailed information about the certificate stored in the keystore. The value of the Owner field will be your DFC Client ID. You can use this value to locate the DFC client you need to approve in DA.
